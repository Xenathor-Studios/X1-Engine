This file contains all error codes associated with the X1 Engine. Along with each code, you will see the error message
that gets printed in a message box to the user and a detailed interpretation of the message, helping to troubleshoot and
solve the problem. There is no particular order to the codes; I'm writing them here as they're created. The parameter of
System.exit() corresponds to the code. I'm starting the count at 2 because 0 is Clean Exit, and 1 is General Unclean
Exit.

These errors are primarily for programmers developing with the X1 Engine. Ideally, players should never receive these
error messages.

#       Message                                                Description
2       Tick took too long: Tick optimization       One tick, or update cycle, took longer than the 16.666ms allotted
        required. Error code 2.                     for each game loop iteration. That means the game is running slower
                                                    than 60FPS. Because the game runs on a fixed cycle time, the game
                                                    thread sleeps, or waits, the difference between how fast update()
                                                    and render() ran and 16.666ms. Threads cannot sleep for a negative
                                                    amount of time, so the game crashes. Presently, the only solution is
                                                    to figure out why update() and/or [most likely] render() took more
                                                    than 16.666ms to run, and optimize their code to run faster. We plan
                                                    on adding a component to the game loop that cuts down on the
                                                    rendering time without changing the update cycle time automatically
                                                    when it thinks it will sleep the thread for negative time.
3       Line out of bounds: No more data left to    The line of the file the game tried to access doesn't exist as its
        read in file. Error code 3.                 line number is larger than the number of lines in the file. This can
                                                    occur when you have at least one more getNextDataLine() call to a
                                                    specific file than there is data in the file. Make sure this isn't
                                                    the case. This can also occur if you're loading data into an array
                                                    and the loop runs for too many iterations. Generally, this error is
                                                    due to a programming fault rather than an engine bug.
4       Passed array longer than called array.      The array that was passed into setAllArguments was longer than the
        Error code 4.                               array that called setAllArguments. Make sure they are either the
                                                    same length or that the array passed into setAllArguments is shorter
                                                    than the array calling setAllArguments. If you are sure that you
                                                    only want to copy over enough data to fill the calling array, but
                                                    not copy over all the data in the passed array, remove this block
                                                    { if(arguments.length > this.eArgs.length) } from setAllArguments.
                                                    This code also applies to setAllArgumentKeys and setAllArgumentData.
